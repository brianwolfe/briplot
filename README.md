briplot
=======

Personal python plotting repo on top of matplotlib to generate my preferred graphics.

matplotlibrc is a configuration file, I put it in ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc in order to have my preferred default coloring
and font schemes. I had to install several custom fonts (in particular, Helvetica truetype fonts) 
for this to work, so it may not work with default configurations of OS X or other operating systems.
